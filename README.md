# Detecting fraud on Enron Email Dataset Using Machine Learning 

This project applies machine learning to the task of detecting potential suspects of fraud in the Enron case. The algorithms analyize features of the Emails Dataset to detect persons of interest. This is part of the course work for the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
